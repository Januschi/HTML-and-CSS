# Description
This repository contains the assignments done in ITEC 2915 (HTML & CSS) while at Southwest Tech, which I have saved as evidence of my abilities to show to future employers.
# Bio
I graduated from De Pere High School in 2015. I spent most of my childhood and adolescence living in Wisconsin. I moved to Utah in December 2015, and lived at many addresses before relocating to Cedar City in April 2019.
# Goals
I am taking web development at Southwest Tech to start my path to a normal career. I've worked a couple of dead-end jobs over the last few years before realizing the importance of higher education. When I finish this course I expect to first complete an internship to build up my experience and skill set. Afterwards, I hope to be hired as an entry-level web developer. These are my goals for the foreseeable future.
